# Describing this in words gets complicated and confusing. Iâ€™ll describe it in variables and values instead.

# First 1 is assigned to a, then 6 is assigned to d. This leaves only the arguments with default values. Since 5 has not been assigned to a value yet, it is given to b and c uses its default value of 3.
