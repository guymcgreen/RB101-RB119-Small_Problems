Locate the ruby documentation for methods File::path and File#path. How are they different?

File::path is a class method that are called on the class

puts File.path('bin') # calls the class method File::path since we are calling it on the File class

IO#path calls the instance method since we're calling it on an object of the File class, namely f

f = File.new('my-file.txt')
puts f.path
